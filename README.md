## Predict-number-of-student-admitted-to-American-College-using-linear-regression

The type of dataset and problem is a classic regression. Given a number of elements all with certain characteristics (features), we want to build a machine learning model to identify the **number of people accepted**.

To solve the problem we will have to analyze the data, do any required transformation and normalization, apply a machine learning algorithm, train a model, check the performance of the trained model and iterate until we find the most performant for our type of dataset.
